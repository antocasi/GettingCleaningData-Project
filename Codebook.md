## Dataset description
The tidy dataset generated by the run_analysis.R script derives directly from the UCI Machine Learning repository Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset. This original dataset cointains measurements obtained through the accelerometer and the gyroscope of a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone. 30 different subjects wearing the smartphone were analysed during six different activities (manually annotated) capturing the tri-axial linear and angular velocity mesured by the smartphone sensors. The obtained dataset has been randomly divided in two groups: a train set and a test set.
